# SI
A header only c++ library that uses user defined literals to help with SI-unit conversion at compile time. 


This is a learning project to figure out modern C++ user defined literals and probably some template and type-traits magic as well. 

The goal is to provide as many conversions and arithmetic operations with values of any of the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) as possible with strong type safety already during compile time.
